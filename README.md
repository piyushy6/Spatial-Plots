# Spatial-Plots
This script helps to plot data on a map.

This could be helpful to get information about spatial variations. In this script I have plotted data on google Map for PM-2.5 values obtained from mobile sensing by integrating sensor on car.
Different GPS coordinates (Lat-Long) corresponds to different PM-2.5 values.
